**Dyvil** is a multi-paradigm, general purpose programming language that is based on Java and the JVM.
It is compiled, statically and strongly typed and supports object-oriented, functional and imperative
programming styles. The modern and extensible syntax is based on Swift, Kotlin and Scala.

As a new programming language in active development, the main goals of the Dyvil project are the following:

- to provide modern syntax and semantics
- to avoid common boilerplate code
- to achieve performance comparable to Java programs
- to be fully compatible and interoperable with Java and other JVM languages like Scala, Kotlin or Groovy

In addition to the **Dyvil-to-JVM-Bytecode compiler**, the toolchain consists of an executable **REPL**, a full-fledged
**standard library** including an extensive collection framework, the **Dyvil Property Format** library and
specification, and the **GenSrc** source code generation and text template specialization tool. Information on all
components can be found in the [Language Reference][1].

The syntax and semantics of the language are still highly experimental and are likely to change in upcoming
releases. Therefore it is not recommended to use Dyvil in any kind of production environment.
Feature or change requests or bug reports in the form of GitHub Issues or Pull Requests are welcome and encouraged.
